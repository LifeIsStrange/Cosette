Conditional SQL Rewrite
=======================

1. From Deutsch et al. (Penn TR 2001). NOTE: While supported by their chase algorithm, this rewrite cannot be expressed by our current language of preconditions.

```
schema depts(DName:int, DProjs:int, pn:int);
schema teams(TProj:int, TMember:int);
schema payroll(PDept:int, Empl:int);
table Depts(depts);
table Teams(teams);
table Payroll(payroll)ï¼›
```

```
create view V1 (
    select d.DName as D, d.pn as P, p.Empl as E
    from Depts d, Payroll p
    where d.DName = p.PDept
);

create view V2 (
    select t.TMember as E, p.PDept as D, t.TProj as P
    from Teams t, Payroll p
    where t.TMember = p.Empl
)
```

Q1:
```
select t.TMember
from Depts d, Teams t
where pn = t.TProj and d.DName = "Security"
```

Q2
```
select v1.E
from V1 v1, V2 v2
where v1.D = "Security" and v1.P = v2.P and v1.E = v2.E and v1.D = v2.D
```

Q1 is only equivalent to Q1 if "Security" uses only its own employees on the projects it runs. 

2. Using foreign key to do join elimination. [blog article about oracle](https://danischnider.wordpress.com/2015/12/01/foreign-key-constraints-in-an-oracle-data-warehouse/)

Assume a fact table SALES and 3 dimension tables PRODUCTS, CUSTOMERS and TIMES. There are 3 foreign keys (prod_id, cust_id, time_id) in SALES referring to primary keys of each demension table. 

(I removed group by in the original queries for readablity).

Q1
```
SELECT p.prod_cat, s.amount_sold
FROM sales s, product p, customers c, times t
WHERE s.prod_id = p.prod_id AND s.cust_id = c.cust_id AND s.time_id = c.time_id AND
      t.calendar_year = 2014 
```

Q2
```
SELECT p.prod_cat, s.amount_sold
FROM sales s, product p, times t
WHERE s.prod_id = p.prod_id AND s.time_id = c.time_id AND t.calendar_year = 2014 
```
